# DeepLearning-Section-1
This project is a Python script that scrapes random articles from WikiHow, extracts the titles, subheadings, and step-by-step instructions, and saves them in a CSV file. The script fetches multiple articles using the WikiHow randomizer and processes each article's content, cleaning and formatting the text for easy storage and analysis.
